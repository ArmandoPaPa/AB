            <strong>Welcome to my CV webpage project!</strong><br>
            <p>
            I am learning IT and I enjoy every minute of learning and every task I get. 
            I would like to be a part of an IT team and learn even more, challange myself and develop my further carreer in this sphere. <br><br>
            I am responsible and hard working. During the years I have developed certain my talents but I think that responsibility and hard work each day is more important and helps in developing expertise in the field and acknowledgement of the details. I always aim for perfection but I know when to stop and keep moving forward so that deadlines are always met. If the task allows I love being creative and think out of the box also taking into the consideration rules. I love being proactive and taking initiative and cooperate. I like also teamwork and achieve goals together. <br><br>
            With my resposible attitude and hard work I have graduated from Riga State 1st Gymnasium and Stockholm School of Economics in Riga (SSE-Riga). I have also MBA in International Business from University of Latvia. I love learning and try to learn each day taking courses in Udemy or listening to audiobooks or podcasts. Recently I finished training in Power BI – data analysis and visualization. Currently I am learning software engineering (Java, C#, Web) and Agile, Scrum, Jira (Udemy). In the new job I am also ready and willing to learn and deepen my expertise in any job related field. <br><br>
            I have broad work experience as I have worked in different spheres – I was accountant in my student years and I have done data analysis for State Revenue Service Modernisation project, analysing effectiveness and efficiency. I have worked a lot with different projects in the spheres of innovation, investments, IT, export, energy efficiency. I have prepared project documentation including business plans and financial analysis. I have evaluated projects prepared by others and done data analysis. I have helped implementing projects and prepared final documentation. <br><br>
            Also I have organized different parties in my student years. In Latvian Investment and development agency (LIDA) and Enterprise Latvia (EntLv) I have organized a lot of seminars and conferences, and I have done public speaking in those events. I have experience in marketing as well as I was LIDA Marketing department director and LIDA Marketing project unit director and later in EntLv I was responsible for attracting new clients and developing relationships with them. I have managed teams to meet deadlines and budget. <br><br>
            In each of the spheres I try to get deep expertise and my broad work experience allows me to learn new things easily and see solutions from different angles. Now I am full of energy to get back to labour market, work and develop my career. My work experience is described in my LinkedIn profile in more detail and I am always ready to meet you and answer all your questions.
